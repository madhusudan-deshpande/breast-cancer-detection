# <u> Breast Cancer Detection </u>


### <u> Project Overview: </u>

* According to the WHO, breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were 2.3 million new breast cancer diagnoses and 685,000 deaths. Early detection and treatment are critical to reducing cancer fatalities, and machine learning could help streamline the process that radiologists use to evaluate screening mammograms. Machine learning can help to develop personalized treatment plans based on individual patient characteristics, such as age, medical history, and genetic information, thereby improving the effectiveness of treatment and minimizing side effects. Overall, the motivation for using machine learning in breast cancer detection is to improve the accuracy, speed, and personalized nature of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes and survival rates.


### <u> Data Sources: </u>

The dataset that we are going to use for this is the RSNA Breast Cancer detection from Kaggle. This data comprises tabular as well as image data. It contains metadata of about 65k patients and around 260k+ mammograms in the DICOM format.
